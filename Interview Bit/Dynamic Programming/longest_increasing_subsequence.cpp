*
* Find the longest increasing subsequence of a given sequence / array.
*
* In other words, find a subsequence of array in which the subsequenceâ€™s elements are in strictly increasing order, 
* and in which the subsequence is as long as possible.
* This subsequence is not necessarily contiguous, or unique.
* In this case, we only care about the length of the longest increasing subsequence.
*
* Example :
*
*   Input : [0, 8, 4, 12, 2, 10, 6, 14, 1, 9, 5, 13, 3, 11, 7, 15]
*   Output : 6
*
*   The sequence : [0, 2, 6, 9, 13, 15] or [0, 4, 6, 9, 11, 15] or [0, 4, 6, 9, 13, 15]
