* Find largest distance
* Given an arbitrary unweighted rooted tree which consists of N (2 <= N <= 40000) nodes. 
* The goal of the problem is to find largest distance between two nodes in a tree.
* Distance between two nodes is a number of edges on a path between the nodes (there will be a unique path between any pair of nodes since it is a tree).
* The nodes will be numbered 0 through N - 1.
*
* The tree is given as an array P, there is an edge between nodes P[i] and i (0 <= i < N).
* Exactly one of the iâ€™s will have P[i] equal to -1, it will be root node.
*
* Example:
*    If given P is [-1, 0, 0, 0, 3], then node 0 is the root and the whole tree looks like this: 
*
*          0
*       /  |  \
*      1   2   3
*               \
*                4  
*
* One of the longest path is 1 -> 0 -> 3 -> 4 and its length is 3, thus the answer is 3. Note that there are other paths with maximal distance.
